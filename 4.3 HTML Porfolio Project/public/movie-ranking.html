<h1>Sabrina's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>3 Movies I Enjoy... Because "of All Time" is too Serious</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Frozen II</h3>
<p>This is definitely my top rated animated movie. <br />
The score. The detail. The emotion. 10/10.</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>I feel this one is self-explanatory.</p>

<h3>About Time</h3>
<p>I had to throw a RomCom in here, and though there are many I considered, this one is superior. <br />
    It's naturally full of love and laughter, but also wonder. It feels relatable in a beautiful way.</p>
