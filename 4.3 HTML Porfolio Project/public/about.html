<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>I stumbled upong my interest for front-end development by accident, while I was working on updating information on a company website.</p>

<p>The website's built-in abilities for displaying information were not aesthetically pleasing enough for me. However, I noticed a text field that allowed me to input HTML with in-line CSS. I played around in it and LOVED the potential.</p>

<p>I decided to dedicate more time in my new favorite playground. So, here I am, learning everything I can!</p>
